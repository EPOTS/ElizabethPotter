        <h2>Mast Brothers Chocolate Factory</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, 2 brothers began making chocolate-literally
        from bean to bar- in their Brooklyn, NY, apartment, perfecting
        each piece with artisanal touch and wrapping them with butcher paper.
        Today, Mast Brothers has set up a Brooklyn Chocolate Factory. Where 
        they offer tours of the factory daily. As the tour comes to a close,
        guests enjoy 5 chocolates so they can discover how different beans
        yield different but mind-bogglingly delicious flavors.
