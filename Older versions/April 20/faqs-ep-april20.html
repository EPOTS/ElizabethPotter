                   <p>Chocolate comes from the cacao tree, some of which are over 200 years old.  The tree produces flower clusters, made of pink and white 5 petaled blossoms. Thousands of these flowers are produced, but only about 1 in 500 flowers goes on to produce a pod. These pods contain the cocoa beans, the part that is later used to make the chocolate that we love to eat.</p>

                <p>Nobody knows for sure, but there seems to be a general consensus that the cacao tree first appeared in Central and/or South America a very long time ago.</p>
                <p>Chocolate was originally consumed by the famous Meso Americans (Aztecs, Mayan, and lots of others) as a drink.  It was not until 1847 that the first chocolate bar was made.  A big thanks to  J.S. Frye & Sons, a British chocolate company, for revolutionizing the consumption of chocolate.</p>

                <p>Tempering is an important step for making delicious chocolates!  To temper chocolate, the chocolate is heated, held at a specific heat, stirred for a length of time (see video below), and then cooled at a controlled rate.  </p>

            <div class="faq_response">
                <p>Tempered chocolate has a sheen and a hard texture that snaps.  It melts at a higher temperature than untempered chocolate and does not “bloom”, as long as it is stored at the proper temperature.  It is recommended to use tempered chocolate for chocolate confections (filled chocolates, chocolate covered fruits, chocolate bark)  that will be eaten at room temperature and need structural integrity.  Untempered chocolate is used for baking or other methods where the chocolate must become very hot (chocolate chip cookies, chocolate fondue, fudge).</p>
